# Arma-3-Scripts

dbgStats.VR contains scripts to help measuring lag due to AI units in the mission

It shows the current number of AI men and vehicles and also has a chart that shows the FPS changes and unit counts over time

It also displays other things such as server FPS


The script is WIP (Work in progress)


NOTE: To put this script into your mission requires some level of scripting knowledge
